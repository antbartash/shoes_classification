The aim of the project is to classify images of Nike, Adidas and Converse shoes using convolutional neural networks. <br.
The dataset was obtained  downloading images from Google Images. It has 2 folders: one with the train data and one with the test data. The train-test split ratio is 0.14, with the train dataset containing 711 images and the test dataset containing 114 images. All images are 240x240 pixels in RGB color model.
