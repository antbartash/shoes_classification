# Nike, Adidas and Converse Shoes Images Classification
The aim of the project is to classify images of Nike, Adidas and Converse shoes using CNNs. Due to small size of the dataset, transfer learning was used to create a classification model. <br>

## Dataset
The dataset was obtained by downloading images from Google Images. It has 2 folders: one with the train data and one with the test data. The train-test split ratio is 0.14, with the train dataset containing 711 images and the test dataset containing 114 images. All images are 240x240 pixels in RGB color model.

## Results
As a result of the project a convolutional neural network was built. <br>
The accuracy of the model is above 0.98 on the training set and 0.9211 on the test set.
